# My Home Assistant setup:


**PLEASE NOTE I AM COMPLETELY RECONFIGURING HOW MY CONFIG FILES ARE ORGANISED AND THIS README IS OUT OF DATE, IT'S ON MY LIST OF THINGS TO FIX!!**


This is my current Home Automation setup.

## House:

3 storey townhouse, consisting of:
 - A living area on the groung floor (Living room and kitchen/diner)
 - Hall stairs and landing leading to first floor.
 - Boys' bedroom, Girls' bedroom and bathroom on the first floor.
 - Stairs leading to Master bedroom on the second floor.

Click here to see the [Hardware and Software](extras/github_resources/readme_files/hardware_software.md) I am using around the house.

## What it does:

**This section needs re-writing as timeline / automation based.**
 
## Configuration

Click [here](extras/github_resources/readme_files/configuration.md) to see how I've configured it and how this repo is organised.

Click [here](extras/github_resources/readme_files/backups.md) to see how I manage backups and ensure my config is valid with GitHub, TravisCI and Dropbox.

Click [here](extras/github_resources/readme_files/screenshots.md) to see how it looks! **(NOT WORKING - SORRY!)**
