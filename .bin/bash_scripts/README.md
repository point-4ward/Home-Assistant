# Bash scripts

These scripts are run on the host system for maintenence purposes.  They can be run via scripts in homeassistant if required.

The Github bash scripts here were inspired by BrianJKing - https://github.com/brianjking/homeassistant-config , and Tommatheussen - https://github.com/Tommatheussen/Home-Assistant-Configuration

The Dropbox sync was inspired by Martikainen87 - https://github.com/martikainen87/Home-Automation/wiki/Backup-your-configuration-to-Dropbox
