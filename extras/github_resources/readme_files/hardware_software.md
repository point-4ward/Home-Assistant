# The hardware and software I am using:


## Hardware builds:

### My controllers
I have created some controllers with Raspberry Pi's that I am using in the project, they follow a naming schematic 'node' followed by a number starting at zero so they can be identified and connected to easily on the network:
 - Node-zero - a Raspberry Pi 3 with a Z-wave.me Razberry module and a VSL bluetooth adapter, running Homeassistant and Mosquitto.  This is the main hub of my Home Automation system.
 - Node-one - (Coming soon - a Raspberry pi MQTT alarm controller).
 - Node-two - (Coming soon - a Raspberry pi RF transmitter/receiver).

### My home-brew sensors
I have created some sensors with NodeMCU boards:
 - Sensor-one - (coming soon - motion sensor).
 

## Integrated platforms:

### Networking
 - Asus wifi router with USB NAS attached - connecting everything and centralised storage/backups.
 - Netgear 5 port switch - allowing to have lots of wired connections for reliability.

### Philips Hue
 - Hue Bridge.
 - 3 x Colour bulbs.
 - 5 x White bulbs.
 - Hue Tap (Scene controller).
 - Hue dimmer (light controller).
 - Hue motion sensor.

### Zwave
 - 2 x Fibaro FGD-212 dimmers - for non-hue lighting.
 - Fibaro FGMS-001 multi-sensor - sensos movement, light levels and temperature.

### Broadlink
 - RM3 IR sender - to control non-smart infra-red devices.
 
### Media
 - Wetek Openelec - running Kodi.
 - 5 x Google Chromecast Audios - for multi-room music.
 - Usual home theatre stuff - TV/Blu-Ray/AV Receiver/Games Consoles
 
### Interfaces
 - Amazon Echo Dot - for voice control.
 - Samsung 7" tablet - for interactive touchscreen access.
 - Comag 10" tablet - for interactive touchscreen access.
 - Telegram App (on mobiles) - for two-way conversations with homeassistant.
