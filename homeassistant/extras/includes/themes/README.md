# Themes

The themes I use in my HA frontend

Midnight was created by marcelhoffs - https://community.home-assistant.io/t/midnight-theme/28598

DarkCyan and DarkRed were created by broesie - https://community.home-assistant.io/t/dark-cyan-theme/28594  /  https://community.home-assistant.io/t/dark-red-theme/28592

DarkOrange was created by Bram_Kragten - https://community.home-assistant.io/t/orange-theme/28601

I use the default theme during the day, Midnight in the evening, DarkCyan through the night, DarkOrange when the system is in maintenance mode, and DarkRed when the Alarm is armed.
